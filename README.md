Under the Releases section, download the .exe file to try out the game, but only if you know how to tell Windows to execute the file. Don't if you don't trust me though...

# Pathfinder
Pathfinder (1974) built with [olcConsoleGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos) by Javidx9

For a brief explanation of the game see [this TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8nP15tb/) by @obscure_board_games.

TL;DW:\
Pathfinder is a 2 player maze exploration game similar in gameplay to battleships, where each player sets an objective and a maze for the opponent to navigate through.
Like in battleships, the players have to get to know the opponents setup blindly by guessing possible moves and tracking the progress on a separate grid.
