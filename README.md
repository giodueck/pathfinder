Pathfinder (1974) clone using the olcConsoleGameEngine by Javidx9

For a brief explanation see [this TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8nP15tb/) by @obscure_board_games.

TL;DR:\
Pathfinder is a 2 player maze exploration game similar in gameplay to battleships, where each player sets an objective and a maze for the opponent to navigate through.
Like in battleships, the players have to get to know the opponents setup blindly by guessing possible moves and tracking the progress on a separate grid.
